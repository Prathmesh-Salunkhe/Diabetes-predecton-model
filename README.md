This report addresses the prediction of diabetes diseases using various data science and deep learning algorithms.  In India, around 72.96 million cases of diabetes are found in adults. India is second most affected country by diabetes in the world. Diabetes is disease in which the glucose level becomes high. It becomes very hard for diabetes patients to do day to day tasks. Diabetes doesnâ€™t have a cure, but if detected in early stages it can be reversed. Doctors have said that if diabetes is detected in early stage and patient follows the advice of your doctors and nutritionist, diabetes can be reversed. So it is very important to detect diabetes in early stages. We have used data science and deep learning to predict disease using available datasets. Using this model we can predict whether a person has diabetes by supplying some fields to the model. This can be were useful to detect the possibility of disease in early stages.
